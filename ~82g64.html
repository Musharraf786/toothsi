<p>Hi{{user[&quot;system&quot;][&quot;first_name&quot;]}},</p><p>We&rsquo;ve received and evaluated your monitoring photos. We recommend you to continue with the same aligners.</p><p>Few things to remember:</p><p>Use chewies in the front tooth region for 5 to 7 minutes. Wear chewies 4 to 5 times a day and whenever you re-wear your aligners to assure proper fitting of aligners and good alignment of teeth. Please store all sets of aligners until your smile makeover is complete. Got queries? Please feel free to reach out to us on +91 7303330000 anytime between 9 AM - 9 PM, Monday to Sunday. Better yet!
